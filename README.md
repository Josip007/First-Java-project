# First-Java-project

• Assignment: Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a sequence of integers until the user enters a negative number. The program should print the sum of all even numbers entered by the user using a for loop and a switch statement.
If the user enters zero, the program should skip that iteration of the loop using ?? command, and if the user enters a positive odd number, the program should exit the loop using ?? command.. 
Don't forget to use break and continue. In addition, each time the user enters a number, the program should print the corresponding day of the week using a switch statement.

• You should implement the following features in your program: 
• Your program should continuously ask the user for input until he enters a negative number.
• If the user does not enter a number, the program should print an error message, ask the user to enter a correct integer, and continue searching for an entry.
• For each number entered by the user, your program should print the corresponding day of the week using a switch statement. 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 7=Sunday, 8=Monday, 9=Tuesday and so on. • If the user enters zero, your program should skip that iteration of the loop using ?? command.
• If the user enters a positive odd number, your program should exit the loop using
?? command.
• Your program should keep track of the sum of all even numbers entered by the user using
a variable named "sum". • Finally, your program should print the sum of all even numbers entered by the user.
